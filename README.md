# franklins garden adventure

Welcome to Franklin's Garden Adventure Child-Friendly Edition! You are Franklin the turtle. You can move using WASD keys. Your objective is to harvest and eat all 10 apples without getting touched by a bird, bee or butterfly. The number of apples you have harvested is displayed at the top of the screen. If you get touched, you will lose a life. Once you lose 5 lives, you will officially die and have to re-run the game to play again. Good luck and stay safe!
